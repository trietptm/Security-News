        For a site that everyone calls a failing business with no reason to exist, Twitter sure causes a lot of panic when it's briefly offline
        In a move worthy of a Bond villain, Wikileaks dumps more stolen emails the night before an election in which millions have already voted
        A lot of undecided voters are going to be up all night sifting through Podesta's spam folder, weighing that crucial decision
        A raging Assange struggles with the rabbit ear antennas on his black-and-white TV, trying to get a decent signal. Curse you, Ecuador!
        @Pinboard no Mister Bond, I expect you to... uh, idk complain about it online?
        The Podesta email leaks are the slowly-moving crotch laser of our day. https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2013/01/02/10/Goldfinger.jpg ...

        And of course only four links in that article are still alive. I'm not surprised, but I am disappointed in you, @anildash!

        What I thought was a overblown dystopian scenario in 2002 turned out to be naive optimism.

        The Podestas' "Spirit Cooking" dinner?
        I thought that last retweet was a parody, but nope--on the actual WikiLeaks Twitter account. Podesta thirsts for blood/bad performance art
        I was going to vote for Clinton because Trump is patently unqualified and rapey, but Podesta considered attending an Abramović performance!
        CIA: "We need you to discredit Wikileaks before the decade is out, but it won't be easy." 
        To properly adjudicate between the competing forecast models, we'd have to run this election many, many times. Let's not do that.

        How are you supposed to use multiple github accounts when you can't put the same ssh key on more than one?

        Is there a reason github doesn't just give you privileges equal to union of all accounts matching the ssh key used?

        Oh and you know, here's a great piece in 2013 on productivity and monopolies by Barry Lynn. Steal that work too.http://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/julyaugust-2013/estates-of-mind/ ... 
        In other words, if you want to know what social ideas people will steal credit for in a few years, just read Barry Lynn now.
        Incidentally this piece on how our anti-monopoly tradition created Silicon Valley is genius.http://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/julyaugust-2013/estates-of-mind/ ... 
        Interview (mine) with the brilliant Barry Lynn, published earlier this year: https://promarket.org/what-we-have-is-capture-of-the-regulators-minds-a-much-more-sophisticated-form-of-capture-than-putting-money-in-their-pockets/ ... https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/795331909761073153 ...

        Thru this entire election, I can think of only one person who has managed to unite Americans. Everybody hates Comey.

        This is a v interesting thesis. One seemingly effective alternative to shortening patents, but relies on enforcement rather than law itselfhttps://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/795392829581381632 ... 
        Not shortening patents, but enforcing for small enterprises and structuring as nondiscriminatory for monopolists.https://twitter.com/antonhowes/status/795620464517332997 ... 
        Yes. Government forced dominant companies to open up their patent troves.https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/795392829581381632 ... 
        B/c of antitrust pressure, in 1952 AT&T licensed its patent on an obscure item called 'an electronic transistor'.http://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/julyaugust-2013/estates-of-mind/ ... 
        A small co. called Texas Instruments introduced a commercially viable transistor in 1954. "Other early drivers were Motorola and Fairchild."
        In 1969, IBM unbundled software from hardware due to antitrust pressure. The modern software industry was born.http://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/julyaugust-2013/estates-of-mind/ ... 
        Point isn't to say antitrust is good. It's not. It just is. Point is that concentrating power can mean bottlenecking innovation.

        Decided to re-make one of my sideprojects in Laravel Spark. User management, billing & invoicing out of the box. So nice! 
        I've got a bunch of little tools that are used quite often, time to see if I can make those more professional.
        Free for starters, but with a paid subscription for "power users". Spark makes that *so* easy.

        Looking forward to both self driving cars (work while commute) and work-at-home being the new default.
        Also: need a car hobby. Listening to podcasts is passive, could use an active counterpart. Knitting? Power lifting? What do you when stuck?
        When you're at the point where you shut off the engine because traffic has no sign of moving, you get bored.
        Maybe I should do more car-recordings for the podcast, pure monologues ...

        Regardless of the outcome of the election, Russia's information ops against the US have been wildly successful. /1

        /3 Russia has plausible deniability for Fancy Bear hacks, as apologists point out. But Putin benefits just from the impression he ran them.
        /4 If Trump loses, US still looks bad. If Trump wins... Putin looks like a genius.
