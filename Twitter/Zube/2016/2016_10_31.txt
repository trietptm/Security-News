        Look being bad at handling licensing of external components is going to be picked up by auditors if you ever IPO or are in acquisition talks
        You might believe that the GPL is an unfair license but you're still going to have to explain what your patent policy is around Apache 2
        If your developers are being sloppy about following licenses then you *will* suffer in the long term. Fix the problem, don't pretend it's ok
        Here, Wix's best plan is to remove the GPLed code, apologise and hope they don't get sued. Antagonising the copyright holder doesn't help.
        Instead they demonstrated ignorance of licensing obligations, lack of engineering oversight and pissed off someone who can sue for $$$
        ... which means you start asking what *else* they might be fucking up. Way to set themselves up as a lawsuit target and undermine their value.

        Fake toaster hackedhttp://www.businessinsider.com/fake-toaster-hacked-2016-10 ... 
        So tired of traveling.....
        Doing a Windows 10 host reset and telling it to keep my files. Bitdefender flagged onedrive as malicious and removed it. 1/2
        Onedrive has been fucked up with syncs ever since. Process seems nice and straightforward to get Windows back to a clean state
        It even puts a app reinstall list on your desktop
        BREAKING: State Department orders families of US consulate employees to leave Istanbul because of security concerns.
        Doing a Windows 10 reset also suspends bitlocker while it reinstalls. So there is no reason to re-encrypt.
        I may have to do a blog write-up on regenerating bitlocker recovery keys without re-encrypting. I regen mine every quarter
        Most people do not regen their bitlocker recovery keys. @msftsecurity should make it easier to regen these in case of compromise
        Also DMA attack mitigations for bitlocker should automatically be enabled when you turn on bitlocker but MS doesn't do it.

        Top HN comment on a story about a woman shamed to suicide after being blamed for her violent rape is an MensRights appeal.
        As the father of a teenaged boy and a teenaged girl: "MensRights" makes me far more scared for the boy.
        Another noxious nerd trope about rape: "it would be less of a problem if we could just be less prudish about sex." Fuck you.
        Largest subthread on that rape/suicide story: was the story unfair to WhatsApp? Are WhatsApp's interests being represented carefully enough?
        ESR "speaks medicalese", can tell "fakes" from true rumors, and, noting "glassy stare" is confident HRC is "damaged" by "alcoholism".
        Were ESR her doctor, Hillary would be receiving "intramuscular B12 shots daily". 
        Also: "SJWs" who protest the national anthem at football games have ruined the NFL, says ESR.
        ESR, may I remind you, is such an earnest libertarian that if you voice a statist argument near him, he will shoot you.
        He's also a Wiccan and an interesting thinker, so credit him for an interesting twist on Aleister Crowley there.
