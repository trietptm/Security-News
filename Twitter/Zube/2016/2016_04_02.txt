        It is incredulous that to get paid in the bug bounty, you have to pass a background check http://www.defense.gov/News-Article-View/Article/710033/hack-the-pentagon-pilot-program-opens-for-registration ... 
        Luckily, all the hackers who can't pass a background check will stop hacking the pentagon because they want to follow the rules.

        Seriously, as a scientist who depends on grants, if I go rogue, it's not going to be to get grants. I'll do securities fraud or something.
        Also, anyone who commits a fraud where you have to pay more than 50% overhead on the proceeds to the university is just doing it wrong.

        It's April Fool's, the day we get to discover who in the marketing department wanted to be a comedy writer and why they didn't make it.
        So, on this 1-APR, here's a thought for how to end ransomware entirely as a going concern.
        Deploy a widespread ransomware campaign with dual timers: a "time before key is available" timer, and a "time before your key is gone" timer
        The first timer will be a few days, to really get this thing in the news and properly publicized.
        The second timer is a few days longer than the first.
        When the first timer executes, the instructions for "send bitcoin to the following address" show as normal....
        ....and it's an invalid address. It's not possible to redeem the keys. Not that the keys are redeemable anyway.
        Because they've been trashed.
        The -only- thing keeping ransomware afloat is the assumption that you'll get your data back if you pay. Kill this, and it dies.
        Yep, this'll be painful as all get out. And it's illegal as all get out. But it would ruin the trust in criminal benevolence people have.
        Not sure -why- people trust criminals, really, but there you have it. Kill the trust, kill the market.
        And now decide if this is a joke or not.
        If I get another email from this recruiter, whom I have never responded to, for this job I don't want, I'm quoting $1000/hr.
