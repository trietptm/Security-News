        Looks like Pangu just discovered GOT overwrites... Something the author of watchtower apparently didn't know abouthttps://twitter.com/ihackbanme/status/761323243131183105 ... 
        Context of previous tweet: iOS kernel patch protection did not protect GOT of kernel drivers at all. Disable protection by redirecting funcs
        Do we have a special term for low hanging fruit that hangs so low you have to actively avoid it to not stumble over it?
        @i0n1c We Germans must have a word for that
        I read that the Apple PR talk at #BHUSA is about to start. Wanna bet the guy will claim iOS is so secure and they just released 9.3.4 
        So how much bounty for iOS 10 kernel code execution via bugs "fixed" in iOS 6?
        Is it an Apple bug bounty program or an exploit bounty program?
        Oh I read Apple is not starting a real bug bounty only one where invited (aka Apple friendly) researchers can submit 
        In light of the Apple bug bounty program this is the right time to remind you of https://www.sektioneins.de/blog/16-08-04-trainingBerlin.html ... 
        After Apple's malicious banning of SysSecInfo by making up rule violations I can only warn people to submit to their bug bounty blindly
        I just emailed security@php.net - last time feels like years ago
        The Apple bug bounty is a great example of how all bug bounties are not created equal.
        99.9% of "researchers" after reading the headlines about Apple's bug bounty:
        Closed BB like Apple's are bad, because people (except the chosen few) will stop reporting their bugs until program is open.
        Idea of a bug bounty program is to attract 3rd parties to submit bugs. If you limit invites to those who already submit bugs anyway you fail
        I wonder how many of the people submitting bugs to Apple at the moment are actually allowed by their contracts/visa to take bounties at all.
        .@davidrook if you sit on ios bugs and just learned that you can get up to 50k for them the moment program opens up > you stop reporting now

        That notion that policy and politics have no relationship with one another? Exhibit A.https://twitter.com/jeffersonsnotes/status/761199089945944064 ... 
        What happened in the 2010 election was simple. Foreclosure crisis and giant recession killed Democrats.
        Easier to believe the fantasy that it was an evil genius than to accept responsibility for mismanaging the American home.
        Easier to believe in evil magic than accept one's responsibility for the profound disillusionment of the American voter.

        So among Trump's new economic advisors is John Paulson, who actually helped caused the financial crisis.http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-idUSKCN10G1ES ... 
        Paulson was actually the guy rigging the housing market. He should have been investigated.https://www.propublica.org/article/why-havent-bankers-been-punished-just-read-these-insider-sec-emails ... 
        Paulson was a mediocre hedgie for years, then made $15B during crisis, now mediocre again. Hmmm.
        Relatedly, the Big Short was a dishonestly written story. Paulson was the biggest short, and he rigged the market so he could short it.
        Also Paulson has Alan Greenspan working at his hedge fund. And he pillaged Puerto Rico. Hooray!
        I guess, to be fair to John Paulson, he just took dumb money. It was more Magnetar that drove the market rigging in the real housing market.
