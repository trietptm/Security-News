        The DNC has catered to liberal desires: TPP, pro-fracking, expanded surveillance, expanded war, no single payer healthcare
        No $15 minimum wage, no tax on carbon, no abolition of the death penalty. And it's only the beginning! Welcome to the Progressive Future.

        Intel is considering selling McAfee 6 years after buying it. Their continued use of McAfee branding is cancerous and shows arms-length mgmt.
        I mean, the friggen guy named McAfee made it synonymous with coke-killed orgies and Intel still didn't rebrand. It's stupefying.
        I mean am I the only person who realizes this. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills here.
        "Announcing Intel Antivirus. Now the people who make your CPU, defend your CPU."
        When Taylor Swift is your enterprise security branding thought-leader you have serious problems.
        Four years ago, Intel bought McAfee for $7.3 Billion.
        I interviewed for a security manager position for a company that used McAfee. I never heard back, I think God blocked the call.
        I've actually seen some cool stuff from Intel Security the last two years, these are comments on leadership/strategy not the employees.

        Makes for interesting reading of the literature. Especially the demise of layer-wise pre-training is somewhat surprising.
        When it comes to ReLU activation units: How on earth did people not do this earlier? Cheapest differentiation ever, better properties.
        I mean, you don't really need smoothness for good approximation, piecewise linear is good enough. And the discontinuous spot should not ...
        ... not matter.

        I have a question about the Talinn manual: When country A attacks country C and packets transit country B (and hence use B's infra),  ...
        .. does A need B's prior agreement, like overflight rights? It does not become clear to me from the text?
        Perhaps there is a good reason why IPv6 supports source routing ...?
        Under Talinn, is helping people tunnel through a great firewall (or otherwise bypass national-level filters) an infringement on sovereignty?
        So Rule 92, point 5 covers this, but says that international experts are in disagreement.

        Things are now so comically disastrous I'm starting to enjoy it.
