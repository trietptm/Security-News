        Twitter somehow has 3,800 employees. For comparison, the Boeing team that designed the 747 had 4,500 engineers. And it didn't harass anyone.
        640 engineers should be enough for anyone
        Let me rephrase: 4,500 engineers working with pencil and paper in 1969 could build a GIANT FLYING CATHEDRAL. 3,800 is a lot of engineers
        @Pinboard twitter has 3,800 total employees though, not engineers? they have a lot of sales people and the media account partnerships types
        @Pinboard I remember hearing at a presentation a few years ago they had a design team of 500 and it blew my mind.
        It takes a village to raise a village idiot
        Maybe if all those Twitter employees weren't also working full-time at square, they'd be more productive
        @bobpoekert @Pinboard they definitely have a WAY more responsive ad sales team than Google/FB, and at far smaller spend levels
        It's easy to have a responsive ad sales team when your employee to ad ratio is 1:1
        Twitter HQ this week: "My job is to walk the faxed ad placements over to the sales team. I'm a people person!!!"
        @Pinboard not saying Twitter isn't overstaffed but it's not the best comparison. Design is easy. Implementation and maintenance less so
        If Twitter designed the 747, it would weigh 30,000 tons and be covered in little swastikas

        @kragen Thank you for recognizing @pinboard is a troll. @sama
        "Troll" is the one form of name calling exempt from Paul Graham's iron laws of argument http://paulgraham.com/disagree.html 
        I have epically trolled people by writing and speaking in good faith about the problems in our industry. Zing! Ah, I got you good!
        Troll also carries connotations of living under a bridge, which to a Californian is frankly offensive. No one can afford that kind of rent

        Tricomi equation: u_yy = y u_xx
        The idea of weak solutions to differential equations was developed in the 1930's.
        Burgers' equation: u_t + u u_x = v u_xx
        Monge--Ampère equation http://bit.ly/1A6IvME 
        Chebyshev polynomials T_n(x) satisfy (1 - x^2) y'' - x y' + n^2 y = 0.
        Chebyshev polynomials U_n(x) satisfy (1 - x^2) y'' - 3x y' + n(n+2) y = 0.
        Brief outline of Laplace transforms http://ow.ly/jiZkB 
        Differential equations date back almost as far as calculus, to the late 1600's.
        Power series solutions for DIFFERENTIAL equations lead to DIFFERENCE equations for the coefficients.
        In R^n, Δ u is the sum of the second derivatives of u with respect to each variable.
        Laplace's equation: Δu = 0.
        Helmholtz's equation: -Δu = λ u http://bit.ly/1GsXc3c 
        Heat (or diffusion) equation: u_t - Δu = 0
        Wave equation: u_tt - Δu = 0
        Schrödinger's equation: i u_t + Δu = 0
        Nonlinear Poisson equation: -Δ u = f(u)
        Scalar reaction-diffusion equation: u_t - Δu = f(u)
        Porous medium equation: u_t - Δ(uˠ) = 0
        Laplace's equation was first studied by Laplace around 1780, Stigler's law of eponymy not withstanding.
        For over 300 years, one of the most fruitful ideas in applied mathematics has been to model systems by differential equations.

        "The AT&T-Time Warner Merger: What Are The Pros And Cons For Consumers?"http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2016/10/25/499185907/the-at-t-time-warner-merger-what-are-the-pros-and-cons-for-consumers ... 
        It's a consumer frame. The right question is not about us as consumers, but about us as citizens. Is ATT-Time Warner a threat to democracy?
        That's the point of competition policy. Competition policy is about protecting democracy in the commercial sphere.
        This is the thing. Get police power off enhancing  consumer convenience, price, etc.,  and onto restraining power.https://twitter.com/matthewstoller/status/790955609290072064 ...

        I think the advice people give newcomers about PHP is wrong. Don't use PHP until AFTER you've learned how to build web apps  in (say) Python
        Yes, PHP is very easy to pick up. But unlike almost any other language, PHP won't itself teach you to be a better programmer.
        Yes, some amazing sites are built in PHP. The upside for PHP is as good as any language. But the downside is much worse!
        Great PHP applications are as good as any application on the Internet. Bad PHP applications are worse than any other applications.
        As long as you know exactly what you're doing: PHP totally legit. Not second-guessing strong teams who use PHP!
