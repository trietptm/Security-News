        Prominent right wingers start lining up behind Hillary, right on cue. http://bit.ly/1UzKkkz  via @DougHenwood.
        Trump's a godsend for lazy joke writers. The hair, the face, the  history, the mouth. The 2016 electoral comedy narrative on a platter.
        Yet the funniest thing is that Trump and Hillary are friends.  Fellow 1%ers. He and Bill play golf together. This is a kabuki election.
        But to satirize that would be to satirize the system. No money or  renown in that. Stick to personalities and their assigned roles.
        Easy comedy. The kind that evaporates on touch.
        So many "Bernie turned me off of social democracy, so I'm embracing Hillary's neoliberalism" articles popping up. A betrayed generation.

        The underlying strength of password security isn't complexity.
        The public is being lied to. They are being given the threat model for resisting brute-force hash cracking, not password hygiene for webmail
        2 Factor Authentication's main purpose isn't an enhancement for passwords.
        Password complexity isn't even the main determination of strength.
        @SwiftOnSecurity Security vendors define the threat as the problem they can solve, not the problems we really have.
        Reminder: system level access, far more than password complexity and length, is the root cause of credential loss in most targeted attacks.
        Ability to run Mimikatz = even 128 character randomly generated passwords can be stolen. Protect endpoints, practice credential hygiene.

        An update on SSH protocol 1
        The Myth of Software and Hardware Vulnerability Management 
        Every time someone says/tweets "X should not be connected to the Internet", security gets a little more detached from the real world.
        Extracting again all the CRL URLs and OCSP from a huge set of certificates and again it's a great opportunity for ex-filtration.
        @adulau @circl_lu totally agree with you Alex. very nice blog post!!!

        @billpollock @andrewsmhay I purchased the bundle, I think it was literally the most value for money I've ever received, ever.
        I confess: I haven't been editing day and night recently. I've been taking a pseudo break. I'll get back in gear this weekend.
        sorry, http://nostarch.com  is down. Trying to figure out why.
        I don't know how to process our Humble Bundle success. Where do all these people come from? Maybe they're robots.
        @billpollock I've got most of the books in the bundle, but I'm still supporting it.

        I'm guessing if Clinton loses to Trump, Dem Party activists/operatives will try to blame Bernie as a way to avoid blaming themselves.
        The new answer to every moral, ethical and legal question about Clinton is now "Trump!"...which is a perfect outcome for big money interests

        Don't forget to vote for some feckless, pompous, mendacious, lazy embezzling gobshite tomorrow.
        Dear BBC: it's not so much 'Super Thursday' as 'Unstoppable Shower of Shit Thursday'.
        Don't forget to vote today. It's a good way to bring yourself five or ten minutes closer to death.
        Don't forget to vote today. Unless you plan on voting tory, in which case don't forget to go and fuck yourself.

        My local candidates: Jim Dreadful (Lab), Pippa Shitbag (Con), Adolf Hitler-Wankstain (UKIP), Jemima Nomark (Lib-Dem) and Andy Bastard (Ind).
        I voted with a pencil because I believe in #democracy, and because like a silly bastard I forgot to take a pen.
