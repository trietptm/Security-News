        As far as I can tell, changing your password on Twitter doesn't cycle the OAUTH token you granted to apps, you have to revoke all manually..

        Are you concerned that your iPhone was secretly jailbroken and you are spied on? https://appsto.re/de/TmEAab.i pic.twitter.com/66F8ytJZtd

        This is a huge contribution: System and Security Info iOS Application
        Quite bad for defenders that you need to break layers of encryption and binary sandbox profiles to verify Apple's wrong security claim.
        Btw we will try to add more features to the app. But knowing Apple the app might just disappear...
        . @cristeatweet it was announced like 1 hour ago and apparently the AppStore review had no issues with it.
        One of the jailbreak tests can detect from within the sandbox via timing attack if someone patched kernel to allow task_for_pid0 in iOS 8
        What I learned: quite some people use accessibility functions and those load strange libs in process (needs less threatening GUI)
        I want to see someone running the app and getting "custom jailbreak detected" and no not @qwertyoruiopz
        This looks bad like a private jailbreak caught in the wildhttps://twitter.com/true0mega/status/729657483111895040 ... 
        I have already fixed the false positives - just a matter of upload by colleague and review by Apple
        Turns out that guy knows he is jailbroken and runs anti jailbreak detection software on his phone...
        I wonder if we can catch some FinFisher / HackingTeam in the wild.
        The next version just entered review by Apple - so first fixes hopefully soon
        Previous bug fix reviews of our Application were performed by Apple in hours ( not days )

        1) Now big problem for US universities is that it is often too late to teach mainland students that '89 Tiananmen Massacre really happened.
        2) Seems more useful to use many mainland students' skepticism that PLA killed the Chinese people as a teaching moment for other students
        3) There may be little US educators can do to change years of patriotic PRC education combined with CN govt $ pouring into US universities
        4) Don't underestimate effect of massive CN govt-linked donations to top US universities like Harvard. This phenomenon needs more reporting.
