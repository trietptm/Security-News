        I don't really think it's treason (more like political rhetoric). But if he's elected, could statements like that hinder prosecutions?
        Maybe not now, since he's not in office, but presumably statements by sitting POTUS advocating crimes can have some legal significance.
        We shouldn't worry because when he becomes literally the most powerful person in the world, he'll become less impulsive and egotistical.

        There was a debate over this in the 1960s, over credit scoring. The Fair Credit Reporting Act, the first federal privacy law, was the result
        You have due process rights to credit scores, which is a *privately* maintained platform.
        The Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970 was written by Leonor Sullivan, the only woman on the House Banking Committee.
        And a lot of the debate was how women, gay men, and minorities faced discrimination in credit allocation. Due process in private sphere.
        If internet platforms are significant public infrastructure, then a conversation about due process makes sense.

        Thinking a lot about issues from discussions at HOPE this weekend. Many reasons for transformative justice approaches in hacker communities.
        The goal is to ensure that there's meaningful justice and community safety even if victims don't feel safe involving the state
        But if the victim *does* want to involve the state, how do we ensure that they don't end up silenced or driven out by community norms?
        I'm so overjoyed that people are working to answer these questions and help other communities avoid the same mistakes happening again
        And also that we've got past the point where abusers can trust that they'll (at worst) be asked to leave and the incidents hushed up
        In other news, dealing with Javacard is still basically awful
        The "Snowden fears my monitoring" people are here

        Oh right. Before the Caltrain extension Civic Center was the only logical place to transfer between BART and Muni. Hence the open stairways.
        Although, as far as I can tell, they were never actually used for that.
        BART opened in 1972, Muni didn't start using the tunnel until 1980

        Adam Davidson mentioned a long-ago scuffle with Elizabeth Warren on his podcast recently. I think this is it:http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2009/05/the_full_warren_interview.html?sc=nl&cc=pmb-20090512 ... 
        It's long, but consistently interesting. They do yell at each other, but they both stay pretty civil. Well worth listening to.
        I am not the world's greatest Warren fan but in retrospect: she pretty clearly had the better side of that debate!
        Pay high bug bounties: Internet drama about underbidding the black market. Pay low ones: same drama.
        Conclusion: best to pay no bounties, avoid drama altogether. 
        Stupid rule of law producing results I don't like
        @tqbf a nonzero amount of my HN comments are just in an effort to get enough karma to downvote in bug bounty threads
        I hope so hard that Joe Biden's speech tonight is a multi-level marketing pitch for his new line of Diamond Joe dietary supplements
        Please please please add a line to the new HN guidelines stating that the singular "they" is just fine.
        Any other term besides "Responsible disclosure". Find it, use it instead. Don't add to the problem, researchers.

        Nobody's questioning the logic of Assange being "an avowed foe of Hillary Clinton". How does that make sense?
        I submit that it's possible, maybe even likely, that it's not _Assange_ who's an "avowed foe of Clinton".
        Even Putin's like, uh, ok, @realDonaldTrump, just leave this to us and shut up about it.

        I think Russia will accept Trump's request. A lot of their spying resources have freed up now that he is getting intelligence briefings.
        OTOH I would pay good money for a Yog-Sothoth mug.
