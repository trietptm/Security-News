        Read an amusing exchange about who has more blood on their hands: Hillary or Trump? Of course it's Hillary, hands down. (1/2)
        But someone suggested it's Trump, because people who work for him sometimes prefer suicide. Trump's Temple at Trumptown. Match that, Hills.

        If you are running ImageMagick server-side and unsandboxed, you have not been paying attention since 2006 at least.
