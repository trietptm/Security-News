+         The vastness of the codebases makes me feel lost at sea, the code/design
+  churn gives me whiplash, the complexity confuses and frightens me.
+         The abstraction layers induce vertigo, the memory manager seems to have

+         This is what code looks like after 10+ year deathmarches and competitive
