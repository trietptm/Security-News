+         When security risks are identified and captured as business risks, owned
+  by individual teams, then we'll see prioritization changes
+         We must realign the accountability of security with the owning dev/produ
+ ct/biz teams and position security as an enabler of sec knowledge
+         This accountability realignment w/ focus on security fundamentals at sca
+ le will better position companies against potential breaches
+         Employees are both a target and often the first lines of defense. We sho
+ uld train them on what to expect and how to escalate.https://twitter.com/ATTBusi
+ ness/status/790986811711508480 ...
+         For example we perform proactive phishing attempts with all employees to
+  expose them to potential real world attacks.
+         We also equip all employees with a password manager and the training on
+ how to use it. No more shared/weak passwords
+         Our developers receive secure development training before ever committin
+ g code.
+         We also teach an internal 'security hacking' course to teach employees e
+ xactly how attackers can exploit application vulnerabilities.
+         I believe that an informed and empowered employee base can be an excelle
+ nt partner when facing the multitude of security threats.

+         The natural progression into computers is to understand everything about
+  them. How they work, how to change or bypass the design
+         I started as a hands-on security practitioner that would be hired to com
+ promise/secure applications and systems for banks & gov'ts
+         Over many years I found that making a company secure was more than just
+ the individual technical defenses
+         Instead, even more can be accomplished by empowering security teams and
+ driving the business to tackle a few big security items
+         Advice for students - learn technology, learn to code, learn to break/re
+ build/defend. Security is exciting & you won't be disappointed
+         Take advantage of the numerous free hands-on sec resources. The security
+  field changes rapidly & the ability to 'learn by doing' is crucial.
