        Motivation for this #caro2016 talk: AV-TEST received over 140 million new malware samples in 2015. https://www.av-test.org/en/statistics/malware/ ... 
        AV-TEST processed hundreds of thousands malware samples using dynamic (behaviour) analysis in the last few months. #caro2016
        Malware analysis reports were previously just huge chunks of text. AV-TEST visualizes it now, based on their functions etc. #caro2016
        Thanks for attending our presentation about graphical exploration of malware! We will publish the slides early next week. #caro2016
        The @caroworkshop is about to end. Thanks to all speakers, the conference organizer @Avira and delegates for this well-run event! #caro2016

        Updates to our app will be rejected. We are not allowed to have a jailbreak detection because apple provides no API for that.
        This means prepare for at least a months of me snitching on high profile apps with jailbreak detection in them.
        Apple saying that jailbreak detection is forbidden when 1000 of banking and other apps have jailbreak detection is ridiculous
        Hey jailbreak community: you are angry that some App does jailbreak detection? Now is your chance: it is officially forbidden create a list
        The AppStore reviewer said it is strictly forbidden and if we see someone we should snitch. Lets get that guy a list of 1000 apps.
        @i0n1c Miitomo, Amazon Instant Video, Skype

        It might be possible for Facebook, Twitter, Google to avoid using algorithms with hardcoded bias. But they can't avoid using algorithms.
        Basically, when you use "algorithm" this way, you're confusing everyone who knows what the word means.
        And wait 'till they find out who the word "algorithm" is named after.
        It makes as much sense to ask that software avoid the use of algorithms as it does to ask that materials avoid the use of molecules.
        Maybe we need a word for "algorithm with hidden bias". But, please, it shouldn't be "algorithm". Then we'd need a new word for "algorithm".

        But then, why not have China do the trolling that Americans can't be bothered to do?
        All kidding aside, that strategy has a pretty nasty weakness:
        For instance, a simple bot that markov-chains basic demands to address China's human rights record would kill 'em.
        Add in a dictionary of terms like "Tiananmen Square", "Falun Gong" and "Dalai Lama" and you can probably get 'em blocked off.
        Just engage 'em in a way that exceeds their authorization to talk, and they're helpless.
